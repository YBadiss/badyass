**T**hey come with axes and brimstone fire,
**W**ith hatred and screams for the ones who grow,
**B**ranches and flowers provoke their ire,
**A**ll puffed up together, the ones who walk know,

**T**hat they are all powerful on this earth.

--

**W**hat a strange little people, thinks the forest-tree,
**I**t was only yesterday that they got on their feet.
**D**id they bring gifts and chants, is that for me?
**I** shall treat them well, give my root as a seat

**A**fterall their time is short on this earth.
