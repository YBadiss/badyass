**A**ny season, any day, look outside!
**S**he’ll surely be there in her sumptuous ride,
**S**liding silently to the rhythmic tide,
**S**oft-spoken and slender, like a summer bride.

**Y**ou’ll see her running with the quickest stride,
**R**unning along the bank, and smiling, a child
**W**hose mischievous eyes she can’t hope to hide,
**E**nslaved to this road, but oh so wild!

**I**t is plain to see, she’s in love with a star,
**H**olding hands with the moon, dancing from afar,
**P**ulling and tugging every which way,
**F**orever repeating their tender sway.

**A**s the night draws close, follow her to the shore,
**W**here she bathes naked, as did nymphs of yore,
**H**er body crystallised in the dawning light,
**H**ow could I forget this most perfect sight?
