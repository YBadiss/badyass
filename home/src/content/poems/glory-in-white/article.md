**O**n the last day of summer
**T**here went a lonely flower,
**W**hite of robes, pure of soul,
**A** Lily with a heart of gold.

**S**he met a man, not one of lies,
**A** soft giant, gentle and proud.
**T**rusting the kindness in his eyes,
**S**he took the hand that he held out.

**A**nd so they dance, from morn to night,
**A**nd when by chance, or lucky sight,
**I** cross the path of this shining star,
**I** make a wish, may they dance far!
