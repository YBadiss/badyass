**T**here is a flower out in the sea, floating around in ecstasy,
**S**he’s not for mortal gardens, no, she grows only in heavens.

**T**here’s a flower in the ocean, each glance at her is a vision,
**C**olors play upon her robe, like petals of red, yellow, and gold.

**T**here’s a flower in the ocean, she embodies the perfection,
**H**er smell alone is enchantment, takes you away in an instant.

**T**here’s a flower out in the sea, do you think she might like me?
**T**hat I could be her sun and stars, be I near, or be I far?
