**P**ast the roads and past the rivers,
**P**ast the forever green pastures,
**O**n a morning of fog and blur,
**U**nder Skye merge past and future.

**T**he cold breath of a thousand soldier,
**F**allen braves that never falter,
**T**heir calls echoing in the moors,
**S**lipping through half open doors.

**A**nd where the pouring rain gathers,
**R**elentless curse marking their graves,
**T**here grows azaleas of all colours,
**S**pringing to life from earthly caves.
