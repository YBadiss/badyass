**A**m I having fun under yellow lights,
**A**mong roofless tops and starless nights?

**A**m I enjoying this moment alone,
**D**ancing in the streets as the sirens moan?

**A**m I jumping around a fast turning mill,
**M**y face to the winds and my bones to the chill?

**A**m I feeling now the taste of metal,
**O**n my tongue and lips, the colour of freckle?

**A**m I so foolish not to flee or fear,
**T**he dark of the alley, the red burning tear?

**I**s the sky crying on the city tonight,
**A**s I walk on with joy escaping its smite?
