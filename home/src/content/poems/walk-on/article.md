**A** life is by all means, a long and winding river,
**I**t takes you by the hand, all through health and fever.

**A**t times it is shiny, a sunny day in summer,
**A**nd nothing can reach you, a hero but bolder.

**A**las days fade quickly as the sky gets darker,
**W**ith no hopes but a few in deep nights of winter.

**B**ut do not despair yet on a way full of thorns,
**A**s others walk with you your friendship newly born.

**T**hey will smile through the stings, happy to share the pain,
**W**ith a smile telling you “This walk is not in vain”.

--

**S**o hold hands for a while, just a stroll, or a mile;
**T**ake a step with no fear, and lean on us my dear.
**F**or the road is lonely, pour qui marche sans amis,
**F**or each turn and detour, est un chemin d’amour.
